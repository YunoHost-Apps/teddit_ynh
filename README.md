## Overview

A free and open source alternative Reddit front-end focused on privacy. Inspired by the Nitter project.

### Features

- No JavaScript or ads
- All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Reddit
- Prevents Reddit from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
- Unofficial API (RSS & JSON support, no rate limits or Reddit account required)
- Lightweight (teddit frontpage: ~30 HTTP requests with ~270 KB of data downloaded vs. Reddit frontpage: ~190 requests with ~24 MB)
- Self-hostable. Anyone can setup an instance. An instance can either use Reddit's API with or without OAuth (so Reddit API key is not necessarily needed).


**Shipped version:** 0.4.0~ynh1

**Demo:** https://teddit.net/
